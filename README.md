# moakya.github.io

This is the start of my website that I am creating from scratch using React JS with Yarn as the package manager.

The website is deployed to GitHub pages on my account, and the master branch reflects the build and hosts the files necessary to view the website itself. 

The website itself can be viewed [here](https://moakya.github.io).

The code itself can be found in this repo on the dev branch, that is where all the changes will be made in future. The approach itself seems strange at first, but this is due to the way GitHub Pages operates. 

The idea for agile being that the code for the build itself will be hosted on the dev branch, and any branches that come off that will be for development, and new design. 

Pull requests will be made into dev, and then the deploy command will be run in dev to update the build files needed by GitHub Pages, that will lead to the master branch being updated with the up to date content from the dev branch.

***

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The package manager for this project is [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/).

## Available Scripts for Yarn

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
